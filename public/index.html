		<p>By default, WordPress uses URLs like this http://example.com/?p=123. This URL structure is not SEO friendly. This is why most WordPress site owners use Pretty Permalinks, which is a term used for SEO friendly URLs in WordPress. These SEO friendly Permalinks contain post, category, tag, title in the URL, allowing you to use Keywords inside your URLs.</p>
		<p>To set up Permalinks on your WordPress site, simply go to <code>Settings → Permalinks</code>. There you will see a number of options to choose from:</p>
		<img src="img/permalinks.jpg" alt="">
		<p>So, if you have not done so already, it`s highly advisable to update your permalink settings. Select any option other than default. We recommended <code>postname</code> - as you can see allow.</p>

	<section id="ChildTheme">
		<h1><a href="#ChildTheme">@@name Child Theme</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
		<p>Child themes are separate themes that rely on a parent theme for most of their functionality. If you are using a child theme, WordPress will check your child theme first to see if a specific functionality exists. If it doesn’t, it will use the parent theme. This is great because it allows you to modify only what you need.</p>
		<blockquote>Child themes should always be used if you plan on modifying even a single character in your theme.</blockquote>
		<p>If you plan to edit the theme files, like <code>style.css</code>, we are suggesting you to install both <code>@@slug.zip</code> and <code>@@slug-child.zip</code> themes, then activate the child theme. Child themes are great because allow you to edit the theme and also lets you update the original theme in the future, without loosing your edited files work.</p>
		<blockquote>More about child themes and how to use them you can read <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">here</a></blockquote>
