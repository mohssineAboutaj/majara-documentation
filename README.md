## Theme Documentation
This documentation is perfect for your products. We have added only the necessary elements in order not to overload the documentation.

## Build with GULP
<pre>gulp build</pre>

Build will be added here /build/index.html

## Variables
VLThemes-Documentation is straight HTML, but it utilizes a few "Find and Replace" variables so it's that much easier to plug in your relevant data. Simply conduct a search and replace the following: 

- [ ] `@@name` - Theme Name
- [ ] `@@slug` - theme-name
- [ ] `@@purchaseUrl` - http://example.html
- [ ] `@@demoUrl` - http://example.html
- [ ] `@@supportUrl` - http://example.html
- [ ] `@@changelogUrl` - http://example.html

## Sections
You'll need to add or remove your own sections, but that's easy to do as well - with minimal code.

Add a link in the `header nav` element, like this: `[<a href="#Developers">Developers</a>]` and then add a `section` below with the same ID, like this: `[<section id="Developers">]`. Then just add your content!
